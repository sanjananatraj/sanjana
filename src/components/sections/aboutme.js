        <p>Hello! My name is Sanjana, and I üíó building beautiful websites, interfaces, and apps. I particularly love all things web development and front-facing software. Based in the Bay Area, my interest in coding started when I was in high school, as I was surrounded by all sorts of people in tech. I particularly liked creating and designing websites with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

        <p>While my main interests lie in front end development, I also have a bit of experience in backend technology, such as utilizing Flask and MySQL to build <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://thirdwavecoffeebase.com/">my own RESTful API</a>. Some of my favorite courses in college were about databases, machine learning, NLP, and data visualization.</p>
        
        <p>Now with my Bachelor&apos;s degree in computer science from UCSC, I&apos;m currently seeking out new opportunities for front end/full stack software engineering positions! Reach out to me by <a href="mailto:sanjana.natraj319@gmail.com">sending me an email</a> or by using the <a onClick={scrollToContact}>contact form below</a>. I'm also available on <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjana-natraj/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Here are a couple of technologies I&apos;ve been using:</p>
        
        <ul className={styles.skills}>
          {skills.map((skill, index) => (
            <li key={index}>{skill}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
