[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0cd39d7d-741b-49c4-ba4f-bb8ce40a64f6/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sanjananatraj/deploys)

This is the source code of my personal website! This website was built using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), specifically from Gatsby's starter default. Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered static site generator. It also uses Webpack, Babel, and ESLint, and it has support for TypeScript. 

For optimal performance, the website is hosted on [Netlify] (https://www.netlify.com/), utilizing [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) architecture. 

# About this repo
This website was not intended to be used as a template, so there is no guidance to that. I suggest creating a Gatsby site with [gatsby-starter-default](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) and building a website from there.
